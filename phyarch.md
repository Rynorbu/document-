# Physical Architecture Diagrams - 1-Stop Book Project

## 9. Physical Architecture & Design

Describe the architecturally significant components (or elements) of the solution by describing the physical design which may include the network, technologies, nodes and machines where the components are deployed using physical detail deployment and other diagram as necessary. This is where you can also include and describe the cloud services that you use if any.

The physical architecture of the 1-Stop Book solution is designed to provide a scalable, highly available, and secure deployment infrastructure that supports the microservices-based logical architecture. The solution is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, leveraging managed services to reduce operational overhead while ensuring enterprise-grade reliability and performance.

### Physical Architecture Overview

The physical deployment adopts a multi-tier, multi-availability zone architecture that separates concerns across presentation, application, data, and integration tiers. This approach ensures fault tolerance, enables independent scaling of components, and provides clear security boundaries. The architecture leverages containerization with AWS ECS Fargate for compute resources, managed databases for persistence, and a comprehensive suite of AWS services for networking, security, and operational management.

### Cloud Services Architecture

The solution utilizes the following key AWS services:

**Compute Services:**
- **AWS ECS Fargate**: Serverless container platform hosting all microservices
- **AWS Lambda**: Event-driven compute for background processing and integrations
- **AWS API Gateway**: Managed API service providing centralized request routing and security

**Storage and Database Services:**
- **Amazon RDS PostgreSQL**: Managed relational database with multi-AZ deployment
- **Amazon ElastiCache Redis**: In-memory caching for session management and performance optimization
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage for static assets, file uploads, and backup storage

**Networking and Content Delivery:**
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Global content delivery network for static asset distribution
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Layer 7 load balancing with SSL termination
- **Amazon VPC**: Isolated network environment with public and private subnets

**Integration and Messaging:**
- **Amazon SQS**: Message queuing for asynchronous inter-service communication
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Event-driven integration for system-wide event coordination
- **Amazon SES**: Managed email service for notifications

**Security and Monitoring:**
- **AWS WAF**: Web application firewall for protection against common attacks
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Centralized secret management for credentials and API keys
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting
- **AWS IAM**: Identity and access management with fine-grained permissions

### Physical Architecture Key Decisions

Provide a summary of the significant decisions made in arriving at the architecture of the solution that are related and/or reflected in the physical view. Documented decisions should focus on trade-off choices and rationale. You should continue the numbering from the previous architectural decisions table.

The key architectural decisions taken are as follows:

| Identifier | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **AD-03** | **Cloud-Native AWS Deployment**: The solution is deployed entirely on AWS cloud infrastructure using managed services rather than on-premises or hybrid deployment. **Rationale**: This supports the drivers of Scalability and Maintainability by leveraging AWS's elastic infrastructure and managed services, reducing operational overhead. AWS provides built-in high availability, disaster recovery, and security features that would be costly and complex to implement on-premises. **Trade-off**: Introduces cloud vendor lock-in and ongoing operational costs, but eliminates capital expenditure and reduces infrastructure management complexity. |
| **AD-04** | **Containerized Deployment with ECS Fargate**: All microservices are deployed as containers using AWS ECS Fargate rather than EC2 instances or Lambda functions. **Rationale**: Containers provide consistent deployment environments and resource isolation while Fargate eliminates server management overhead. This supports Maintainability and Scalability by enabling independent service deployment and scaling. **Trade-off**: Higher cost compared to EC2 instances but eliminates infrastructure management and provides better resource utilization than traditional VMs. |
| **AD-05** | **Multi-Availability Zone Architecture**: The infrastructure is deployed across multiple AWS Availability Zones with active-active configuration. **Rationale**: This directly supports the Availability driver by ensuring the system remains operational even if one AZ experiences failure. Database replication and load balancing across AZs provide fault tolerance. **Trade-off**: Increased complexity in deployment and potential cross-AZ data transfer costs, but essential for meeting 99.9% uptime requirements. |
| **AD-06** | **Managed Database Services (RDS PostgreSQL)**: The solution uses Amazon RDS PostgreSQL rather than self-managed database instances. **Rationale**: RDS provides automated backups, security patches, high availability, and performance monitoring, supporting both Security and Maintainability drivers. Multi-AZ deployment ensures database availability. **Trade-off**: Higher cost than self-managed databases and less control over database configuration, but significantly reduces operational overhead and improves reliability. |
| **AD-07** | **API Gateway Pattern with AWS API Gateway**: All external requests are routed through AWS API Gateway rather than direct load balancer access to services. **Rationale**: Centralizes cross-cutting concerns like authentication, throttling, request/response transformation, and API versioning. This supports Security by providing a single point of policy enforcement and Scalability through built-in caching and throttling. **Trade-off**: Introduces additional latency (typically 50-100ms) and cost per request, but provides essential enterprise features and reduces service complexity. |
| **AD-08** | **Event-Driven Architecture with SQS**: Asynchronous communication between services uses Amazon SQS message queues rather than direct HTTP calls or database polling. **Rationale**: This supports Scalability and Maintainability by enabling loose coupling between services and handling traffic spikes through message buffering. Failed messages are automatically retried and moved to dead letter queues for investigation. **Trade-off**: Increased architectural complexity and eventual consistency challenges, but essential for building resilient distributed systems. |

## Physical Architecture Components Details

### Physical Deployment Architecture

The physical deployment of the 1-Stop Book application follows a distributed, cloud-native architecture pattern that separates the system into distinct tiers, each optimized for its specific role. The deployment leverages AWS's global infrastructure to provide low-latency access and high availability.

#### **Network Topology and Infrastructure**

The network architecture implements a secure, multi-tier approach using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with the following topology:

**VPC Configuration:**
- **CIDR Block**: 10.0.0.0/16 providing 65,536 IP addresses
- **Availability Zones**: Deployed across 2 AZs (us-east-1a, us-east-1b) for fault tolerance
- **Internet Gateway**: Provides controlled internet access for public subnets
- **NAT Gateways**: Enable outbound internet connectivity for private subnet resources

**Subnet Architecture:**
- **Public Subnets (2)**: 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24 - Host load balancers and NAT gateways
- **Private Application Subnets (2)**: 10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.5.0/24 - Host ECS containers and application logic
- **Private Data Subnets (2)**: 10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.6.0/24 - Host databases and caching services

#### **Compute Infrastructure Nodes**

**Container Orchestration Platform:**
The application services are deployed on AWS ECS Fargate, a serverless container platform that eliminates the need to manage EC2 instances while providing fine-grained resource allocation:
